-- ─── search_content — add job_postings (Slice 3) ────────────────────────────
-- Extends the global search RPC to cover job_postings (added after the original
-- RPC in 20260628). SECURITY INVOKER keeps per-table RLS in force; the explicit
-- status='active' AND expires_at > now() filter also stops an owner's own
-- pending/filled rows (visible to them via RLS) from leaking into search.
--
-- Fields for result rendering: title = job_title, subtitle = "Employer · District",
-- module = 'jobPostings' (matches the app's module-handler key), id for nav.
